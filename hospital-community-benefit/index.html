<p>As part of its expansion, The University of Chicago Medicine bought Ingalls Memorial Hospital—a nearby community hospital serving the south suburban city of Harvey—in 2016 after announcing 
    <a href="https://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150706/NEWS03/150709916/ingalls-health-in-harvey-looks-to-join-with-a-larger-hospital-system"> a plan the year before</a>
    to unite with a larger entity to achieve greater financial stability.
</p>

<p>The acquisition was partly intended to "enable Ingalls to continue to reinvest in our existing clinical facilities, expand our outpatient services and bring innovative new technologies to patients at a much faster pace," said 
    <a href= "https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/news/2016/october/uchicago-medicine-ingalls-health-system-complete-merger"> Ingalls' president and chief executive at the time.</a></p>
    
<p>But an analysis of almost a decade’s worth of the suburban hospital’s 990 filings indicates that this acquisition does not appear to have similarly bolstered the institution's charitable giving.</p>

<p>The charity that hospitals are required by the IRS to give in order to keep their nonprofit—and therefore untaxed—status is known as a "community benefit." It encompasses giving financial aid to low-income patients and generally improving community health, according to the Lown Institute, a think tank that studies and advocates for equitable healthcare.</p> 

<p>Data show that although UChicago’s Ingalls Memorial net giving increased by almost 30%, or almost $20 million, in the year that UChicago acquired the hospital, there was no long-term increase afterwards. The hospital's net community benefit giving fell to numbers that were similar to or lower than its giving prior to the acquisition.</p>

<p>When it comes to how community benefit giving is affected by an acquisition, it "depends on the system acquiring [the hospital] and their policies/priorities," wrote Lown senior policy analyst Judith Garber over email.</p> 
    
<p>If a health system acquires a hospital and the hospital's community benefit spending increases, this could point to a "larger capacity to do community benefit programming," according to Garber, whereas "if the spending decreases, this could suggest that the "acquiring system has a less generous financial assistance policy or prioritizes privately insured patients."</p>

<p>Although hospitals are required to spend some amount on “community benefit” to keep their nonprofit status, there is no minimum amount that hospitals are required to give as their community benefit.</p> 
    
<p>Hospitals used this lack of rules around spending to spend very little, 
    <a href="https://lowninstitute.org/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-hospital-community-benefit-spending/#:~:text=As%20a%20condition%20for%20their,on%20their%20tax%20form%20990.">according to </a> 
    studies cited in an explainer from the organization.

<p>Ingalls has spent the majority of its community benefit on Medicaid over the past decade, with comparatively little going to community health initiatives.</p>

<p>Compared to other hospitals in the Chicago metro area, Ingalls "is spending proportionately more on Medicaid shortfall and less on everything else except financial assistance," said Garber. Although "part of this is because some hospitals are major teaching hospitals so they will spend more on health professions education and research," Ingalls is "also spending less on community health improvement activities than others in the area."</p>

<p>Certain types of payments—including Medicaid and training of health professionals—have been 
    <a href="https://lowninstitute.org/are-nonprofit-hospitals-serving-their-fair-share-of-medicaid-patients/"> described by the Lown Institute</a> 
    as not providing meaningful benefit to the community.
</p>

<p>The American Hospital Association has <a href="https://www.aha.org/news/blog/2024-03-25-there-nothing-fair-about-lown-institutes-fair-share-report">  argued that </a> Lown's assessment "cherry-picks categories of community benefit and ignores other areas of great importance by omitting the very real underpayments from Medicaid and Medicare that hospitals must absorb."</p>

        </i></p>

        <p><i>Ingalls community benefit data was scraped from ProPublica's Nonprofit Explorer, available <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/362170866"> here. It only examined filings by Ingalls Memorial Hospital, as opposed to The University of Chicago Medicine.</a> This analysis looked only at "net" giving, after direct offsetting revenue was taken into account, rather than "total" giving.</i></p>

        <p><i>A note about the "unidentified spending" category: 
            
To check our work, we added the net values for each 990 community benefit category (that had been filled out by the hospital). We found that when we subtracted that from the hospital's net spending over 9 years (net spending had already been calculated on the 990 form), there is a discrepancy of $2,505,279. This has been assigned to "unidentified spending" in the pie chart above. We are currently working to assign this value to a category.</i></p>
